Piñata is a news aggregator using an Angular version of the jQuery package Gridster to make drag ‘n’ drop resizable widgets. Used news, Giphy, and weather APIs for the widget content. Worked as a team using git - each team member working on their own feature branches. The back-end was Node.js and Express while the front-end was AngularJS. I worked on the back-end, making requests to the database and to the external APIs. I also worked on how the widgets were displayed on the page using an Angular version of a jQuery package called Gridster for the drag ‘n’ drop feature.
