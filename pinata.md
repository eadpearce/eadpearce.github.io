title: WDI Group Project - Piñata

Piñata was made for the WDI group project. It is a news aggregator made using an AngularJS version of the jQuery package Gridster to make drag ‘n’ drop resizable widgets. We used news, Giphy, and weather APIs for the widget content. We worked as a team using git with each team member working on their own feature branch. The back-end was in Node.js and Express. I worked mainly on the back-end, making requests to the database and to the external APIs. I also worked on how the widgets were displayed on the page with the drag ‘n’ drop feature.
