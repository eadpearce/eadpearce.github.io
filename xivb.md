XIVB is a blogging site for players of the game Final Fantasy XIV that grabs data on each userâ€™s in-game character from the [XIVDB](http://xivdb.com/) API. This adds character-specific stats to the profile pages and allows users to make blog posts and comments under the name of their linked characters for roleplay purposes. The back-end was made using Node.js, Express and MongoDB, and the front-end in EJS and jQuery.

A live version of the site can be found [here](https://cryptic-waters-59869.herokuapp.com/)
