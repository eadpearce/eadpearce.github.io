Piano Hero is a game designed to teach people how to play piano either by ear - recognising pitches - or by sight-reading written music. Guitar Hero for classical musicians. The game is a one-page site in HTML/CSS with client-side JavaScript to handle all the game mechanics.  
A live version of the site can be found [here](https://obscure-atoll-38438.herokuapp.com/). The code can be found [here](https://github.com/eadpearce/wdi-project-1) on GitHub. A revised version with MIDI input support can be found [here](https://github.com/eadpearce/project-1-webmidi).
